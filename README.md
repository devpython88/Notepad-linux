# Notepad-linux
I am trying to make a notepad like text editor for linux (Just for coding practices)


specs for this app:
OS: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Linux mint 20.3+
ram: 128 mb
storage: 57 MiB or more
cpu: even a 40 MHz cpu can run this (Considering its a text editor)
gpu: No. (it isnt a game but obvisouly you need gpu for os)
